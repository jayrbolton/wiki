Keys in honest and useful data presentation:

1. _Documenting_ the sources and characteristics of the data
1. Insistently enforcing appropriate _comparisons_
1. Demonstrating mechanisms of _cause and effect_
1. Expressing those mechanisms _quantitatively_
1. Recognizing the inherently _multivariate_ nature of analytic problems
1. Inspecting and evaluating _alternative explanations_
