## Tufte notes

### _Visual and Statistical Thinking_

Principles of effective and honest data presentation:

1. _documenting_ the sources and characteristics of the data
1. insistently enforcing appropriate _comparisons_
1. demonstrating mechanisms of _cause and effect_
1. expressing those mechanisms _quantitatively_
1. recognizing the inherently _multivariate_ nature of analytic problems
1. inspecting and evaluating _alternative explanations_
